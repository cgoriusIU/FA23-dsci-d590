Our application will be able to take in a user's cell features and then predict the likelihood of the cells being malignant. In addition, userâ€™s will be shown the reason behind the prediction, what features are driving that result. The application will also provide a logistic regression model to visualize what factors (features) negatively or positively affects the target variable.
